                    Adire, which means "tie and dye" in Yoruba, is a traditional Nigerian textile art that has been practiced for centuries. 
                    This ancient craft originated among the Yoruba people of southwestern Nigeria and has become a symbol of cultural 
                    identity and artistic expression.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The art form dates back to the early 20th century when Yoruba women began experimenting with indigo dye and 
                    resist techniques to create beautiful patterns on cloth. What started as a way to decorate everyday clothing 
                    evolved into a sophisticated art form that tells stories and preserves cultural heritage.

                      This technique uses starch resist method where cassava starch paste is applied to fabric in intricate patterns 
                      before dyeing. The starch prevents the dye from penetrating certain areas, creating beautiful contrast patterns.

                      In this tie-and-dye method, various objects like stones, seeds, or coins are tied tightly into the fabric

                      This stitching technique involves sewing intricate patterns into the fabric before dyeing. The sewn areas 
                      resist the dye, creating detailed geometric and organic designs.

                      A wax-resist technique where hot wax is applied to fabric in patterns. When dyed, the wax prevents color

                    Adire is more than just a textile art; it's a form of cultural communication. Each pattern and design carries 
                    meaning and tells a story. Traditional motifs often represent proverbs, historical events, or aspects of daily life.

                  <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                    The indigo dye used in traditional Adire comes from the indigo plant (Lonchocarpus cyanescens), which has been 
                    cultivated in Nigeria for generations. The deep blue color is not only aesthetically beautiful but also holds 
                    spiritual significance in Yoruba culture.

                  <p className="text-lg">
                    Today, Adire continues to evolve while maintaining its traditional roots. Contemporary artists and designers
